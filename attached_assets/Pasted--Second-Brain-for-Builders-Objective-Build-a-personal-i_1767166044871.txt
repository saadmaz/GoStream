“Second Brain for Builders”

Objective

Build a personal intelligence system for founders, developers, and creators that captures ideas, connects them automatically, and surfaces insights at the right time — not just a notes app, but a thinking partner.

Core Concept

Most people write notes.

Smart people forget them.

Great builders reuse them at the right moment.

This product turns:



random thoughts

meeting notes

voice memos

links

unfinished ideas

into a living knowledge graph that evolves with the user.

Key Features (V1)

1. Frictionless Capture

Add notes via:

text

voice (auto-transcribed)

browser clipper

No folders required — tagging is optional, AI-first.

2. AI-Powered Connections

Automatically link notes by:

similar ideas

related projects

recurring themes

Visual graph view (Obsidian-style, but cleaner).

3. Contextual Reminders

Example:

“You mentioned this idea 3 weeks ago while working on Project X — want to revisit it?”

Time-based + context-based resurfacing.

4. Idea Evolution Timeline

See how an idea evolved over time:

original thought

refinements

decisions made

abandoned paths

Version history is mandatory.

5. Ask Your Brain

Chat interface:

“What ideas do I have related to fintech in Sri Lanka?”

“Summarize everything I’ve thought about this startup idea.”

Answers must cite the original notes.

Advanced Features (V2+)

Mood-aware suggestions (based on writing tone)

Daily “Idea Digest”

Project mode (ideas grouped by goal)

Export insights to Notion / Markdown / PDF

Offline-first with sync

Tech Expectations

Frontend: Modern, minimalist, dark/light mode

Backend: Scalable, API-first

AI:

embeddings for semantic search

summarization

relationship extraction

Data:

versioned notes

vector storage

Security:

end-to-end encryption (roadmap)

Design Direction

Calm, black & white aesthetic

Subtle motion, no clutter

Feels like thinking, not working

Success Metric

If a user says:



“This app reminds me of things I didn’t even remember I knew.”

You’ve won.
